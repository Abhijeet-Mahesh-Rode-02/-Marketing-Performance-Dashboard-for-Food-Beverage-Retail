# -Marketing-Performance-Dashboard-for-Food-Beverage-Retail
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for a market research firm supporting a food &amp; beverage vendor. Analyzed performance of six recent marketing campaigns and product sales trends. Profiled customer demographics and buying behavior using visual analytics. Identified key drivers of campaign success and customer decision-making.
**Project Title:** *Customer Marketing & Purchase Behavior Analysis using Power BI*

**Summary:**
This Power BI project analyzes customer demographics, campaign effectiveness, product purchase patterns, and platform usage behavior. Using a dataset of customer income, education, age, marital status, campaign responses, and product spending, multiple KPI-driven dashboards were created to uncover actionable marketing insights.
The report provides a deep dive into customer segments such as households with kids/teens, marital groups, and age-based purchase behavior. It also evaluates the performance of marketing campaigns (1–6) and identifies the top channels—store, web, catalog—where customers make their purchases.
The inclusion of DAX measures such as *Total Sales*, *Campaign Acceptance %*, and *Age-based Sales Filters* enhances analytical accuracy and dynamically updates results based on slicers and page filters.

This dashboard helps businesses understand customer buying patterns, improve campaign targeting, and optimize product strategies.
